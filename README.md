## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at George Mason University, with hands-on experience developing machine learning pipelines, building data infrastructure, and analyzing complex datasets across healthcare, clinical research, and behavioral science.

My professional background includes:
- Regulatory science research at the U.S. FDA, where I conducted statistical analyses and quantitative biomarker evaluations using clinical trial data (ORISE Fellow)
- Doctoral research in bioinformatics, focused on explainable AI and causal inference applied to high-dimensional gene expression datasets
- Data engineering and behavioral modeling work for a mobile health game platform with over 500K users (Howard Delafield International)

## Featured Projects (In Progress)

To demonstrate my applied skills and technical breadth, I am building open-source projects using public and synthetic datasets. These projects cover real-world workflows in AI, bioinformatics, ETL pipelines, and cloud engineering.

### `gene-expression-ai-pipeline`  
Predict disease status from gene expression data using machine learning and SHAP-based explainability.  
Tech: Python · scikit-learn · SHAP · seaborn · Docker · Jupyter

### `healthcare-etl-spark`  
Design and deploy a PySpark-based ETL pipeline that ingests synthetic clinical data, performs cleaning and transformation, and writes the results to a PostgreSQL database. The project is fully containerized with Docker to simulate a production-like environment and demonstrates scalable data engineering practices for healthcare analytics.  
Tech: PySpark · Docker · PostgreSQL · pandas · Faker · Bash

### `xai-causal-toolkit`  
Toolkit comparing SHAP explanations and causal inference on synthetic or public datasets.  
Tech: DoWhy · EconML · SHAP · scikit-learn · Jupyter

### `clinical-nlp-pipeline`  
Extract structured information from mock clinical notes using NLP models.  
Tech: spaCy · HuggingFace Transformers · FastAPI · Streamlit

### `portfolio-dashboard`  
Interactive dashboard showcasing models, visualizations, and publications.  
Tech: Streamlit · Dash · JSON backend
